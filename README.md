# AzoSpawner
The minecraft spigot plugin for handling and managing spawners on the server.

##Features
Currently none of our special features are implemented. But in a few weeks they will be done.
We are still working on the project. You can be sure, that this plugin will grow in the future.

##Why should you use AzoSpawner
In a few weeks, AzoSpawner will become one of the most powerful plugins in dealing with spawners.  
At the moment the functionality is not that different compared to similar plugins, but it will be very soon.
There will be daily updates for some time, so the plugin can grow.
We are also working an a great Documentation, so you know exacly what to do.

##Upcoming features
* Full customization of the spawner mining tool (spawner_pickaxe)
* Many administrative functions (like controlling the poperty of spawners)
* More customization in the plugin behaviour (for example how the spawners are mined)
* More user friendly generated spawner names (maybe also customizable)
* ...
